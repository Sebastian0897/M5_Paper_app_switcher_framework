# M5_Paper_app_switcher_framework
A Framework to switch between different apps/ programms on the M5 Paper with a GUI.


# Setup 
- Setup Arduino for an ESP32
- Select the M5 Stack Core2 as the Development Board (I know that is not quite Correct, but it works)
- you can add your programs in the Mode1,mode2,... files
- in the configuration file you can name each mode and select how many modes to display
- flash the files


# Operating the Switcher
- You need to boot the M5 Paper by pressing the Power Button
- hold the Power button until the "mode Selector Touch to Start" Appears
- From then on it is just using the Touchscreen like on your Smartphone
- If you boot the device without holding the power Button it swiches to the last choosen app/programm
  -  on mode change the switcher gives you a fully initialsed and empty Display
